Ideas:
Game Universe crashing.
Worlds merging together.
Corruption spreading, Game universes unite to stop it.
Good Universes fight bad Universes.




				Idea 1,2,and 3.
The game universes were peaceful, full of life, and seperate from one another. Until one day, a bug released in one of the universes, making it crash, slowly deleting itself. Then one after another caught the bug, as it jumped from universe to universe,
attaching itself to it and making more. The protaginist wakes up in their home, almost deleted. As they try to save everyone in their universe, they find a portal. Once they touch the portal, they are summoned in another universe in need.
They need to find the bug and destroy it before all game universes are destroyed, and their home.




				Idea 2-4
Every Universe has a hero and a villian. The villian loses and the hero wins...until they started recuiting friends from other game genres, wanting to end this once and for all. The hero does the same, summoning anyone who is willing to help him.
The protaginist is either good or bad, fighting their rival before being summoned into one, where all universes are to fight. Good against bad, Fighting to see who is truely better. Good, or Evil?
